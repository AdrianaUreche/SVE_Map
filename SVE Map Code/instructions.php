<ul>
<li> Click on your <b>team name</b> in the <b>menu bar</b> to go to your <b>team page</b>.
<li> Click on the <i><b>name</b></i> of a <b>puzzle</b> or <b>quest</b> on your <b>team page</b> to see it
<li> Click on the <i><b>Play button</b></i> to abandon it.  Sorry, we know this is confusing.
<li> Enter the "solution" to the <b>puzzle</b> or <b>quest</b> in the box under the name, or upload a photo/image when asked.  Note that spaces and case (upper or lower) don't matter.
<li> There is no limit to the number of "type in" answers you can submit, but you can only submit once when an image is requested.  Make it count (and treat our reviewers kindly)!
<li> <b>You cannot go back to an old puzzle/quest once you've abandoned it!</b>
<li> More <b>puzzles/quests</b> will be released Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at noon Pacific Time.
<li> To use an <b>ability</b>, select <b><i>ALL</i></b> the blocks to which you want to apply the ability <b><i>first</i></b> (turning them red), then click the red <b>ability button</b>.

<ul><li> You don't lose <b>impact factor</b> when you use an <b>ability</b>.
<li> You start the game with 3 <b>impact factor</b>, earned after you occupy your first block.
<li> You need at least one <b>action point</b> to occupy your first block and start the game.
</ul>

  			<li>Anything “removable” on the game board is a “block” that may be occupied by a team, except for Center Camp and the two smallest wedges near Center Camp (which are stuck and we don't have a screwdriver to pry them loose). </li>
  			<li>To “occupy” a block, a team draws their pattern on it, a.k.a “flag,” “tartan...” </li>
  			<li>The winner of the game is the team with the highest score, calculated as the sum of the points for each occupied block according to the following point schedule:</li>
  				<ul>
  					<li>Each single-sized block: 1 point</li>
  					<li>Each double-sized block: 2 points</li>
                                        <li>The Man: 10 points</li>
  					<li>The Temple: 10 points</li>
				</ul>  
			<li>Completing a puzzle or quest allows a team to <b>either</b> gain an ability (see “Abilities”) or activate an existing ability once.</li>
			<li>The Man and The Temple are adjacent to each other, but <b>not</b> adjacent to any other block on the map.  The Man has the equivalent of <u>three</u> blocks between it and any Esplanade block.</li>
